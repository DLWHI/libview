# libview
Wrapper around SDL to simplify GUI/Window building

# Overview
This library is designed to provide comfortable interface to build window and it's contents easily from code. It provides tools to create and draw window contents. This library was designed to self-use, so if something looks quite sophisticated it is beacuse I like it so(or used to it). 

# Building
I do not provide already built library. Instead I provide headers+source code(as it is "open-source" lib) and cmake that builds library(debug built as it is comfortable for me), so to use it you must first build and then link static library to your project/program
